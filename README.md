# SpeechAnalysis
This project is intended for me to practice NLP techniques using presidential inaugural and State of the Union (SotU) addresses.

Being fairly new to this sort of analysis and coding in general, if you notice ways that I could improve the code (i.e. make it cleaner/faster, inaccuracies found, etc) dm me and let's get in touch!
